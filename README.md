# Causal model selection

Code for cross-validation to select the best predictive model to guide
decision on potential intervention.

The procedure implemented here was validated in the paper [How to select
predictive models for decision making or causal
inference](https://hal.science/hal-03946902)

**This repository is work in progress** We will soon make available here
a simple cross-validation routine for causal model selection.

In the mean time, the causal risks are available is the [study's
repository](https://github.com/soda-inria/caussim/blob/main/caussim/estimation/scores.py).
